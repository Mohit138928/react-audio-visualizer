# React Audio Visualizer

This project is a responsive and interactive audio visualizer built with React. It visualizes microphone or sound input as animated waves or bars, focusing solely on the frontend interface and user experience.

## Core Features

- **Live Audio Visualization**: Displays a real-time visual representation of audio input (waves or bars).
- **Microphone Access**: Users can enable or disable microphone input for visualization.
- **Multiple Visualization Modes**: Provides at least two modes (e.g., waveform and bar graph).
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Theme Switching**: Supports light and dark themes with a toggle switch.
- **Customizable Colors**: Users can change visualization colors.
- **Volume Sensitivity Adjustment**: Includes a slider to adjust the sensitivity of the visualization.
- **Pause/Resume Visualization**: Option to pause and resume the animation.

## Bonus Features

- Option to upload and visualize local audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV).
- Save a snapshot (image) of the current visualization.
- Animated transitions between visualization modes.
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).

## Technical Requirements

- Built with React JS (functional components and hooks preferred).
- Uses HTML5 Canvas or SVG for rendering visualizations.
- No backend or database integration.
- Utilizes CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components) or CSS Modules for styling.
- Ensures cross-browser compatibility (latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Code is well-structured, modular, and well-documented.
